## About this book

The book is obviously about Data Engineering :)

But it is still under development. It has no strict set of topics I want to cover, but it will be pretty close to what I've described in my [Data Engineering Roadmap](/book/1-introduction-to-data-engineering/1.2-data-engineering-roadmap.md).

## How to read this Book

If you are an absolute novice – start with [introduction to Data Engineering](./book/1-introduction-to-data-engineering/1.1-what-is-data-engineering.md). I will explain who are data engineers, what tasks they perform, which skill are required etc.

If you already decided to learn data engineering, but don't know where to start – head on to the [Data Engineering roadmap](./book/1-introduction-to-data-engineering/1.2-data-engineering-roadmap.md). There I show three paths you can take, from absolute beginner to advanced levels.

Lastly, check the [table of content](#table-of-content) down below.
